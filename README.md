# StringManipulation
Simple string manipulation classes and examples

This code is a basic example of String Manipulation and Character counting in Java. 

Main - Run this class with a string as an argument in order to get the reverse of that string. For example the string "manipulation" returns "manipulation is noitalupinam in reverse!"

SecondMain - Run this class to get the count of characters within a string. For example calling the method stringCharCount("abacca"); within the main class returns {a=3, b=1, c=2}
